A web scraping simple script, using beautifulsoup4 , for tracking prices on a website, and send a email with the data scraped to a user. I've pick a random item from 'overstock', just for testing purposes

You can use this for any website you want. IMPORTANT NOTE: on some websites like amazon, aliexpress and others, you won't be allowed to perform scraping, due legal policy.
